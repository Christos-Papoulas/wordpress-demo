    * Product Loop Start
    *
    * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/woocommerce/loop/loop-start.php.
    *
    * HOWEVER, on occasion WooCommerce will need to update template files and you
    * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
    * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
    * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
    * the readme will list any important changes.
    *
    * @see         https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/template-structure/
    * @package     WooCommerce\Templates
    * @version     3.3.0
